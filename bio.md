My name is Don. 

I used to be a drummer in an avant garde progressive industrial band. Since then, I've dabled a bit in electronica without managing to finish a single song. I don't really have time for hobbies. I just practice coding all the time. 

I like sci-fi movies and tv shows, but usually the more cerebral stuff. The last thing the "SyFy" channel produced that I was interested in was Battlestar Galactica (spin-offs included). I was a really big fan of Star Trek: the Next Generation as a child, and remain a moderate trekie. 

My first bachelor's degree was in Political Science at Western Washington University. I graduated in 2009, which turned out to be a terrible year to look for an entry-level job. I got into software development because I thought I needed to learn a hard skill.
