My name is Don. 

I live in the Seattle area of Washington state. My long-time girlfriend and I own a townhouse condo together. We have 3 cats, a never-ending discussion about getting a dog, and no intention whatsoever of reproducing.

I used to be a drummer in an avant garde progressive industrial band. Since then, I've dabled a bit in electronica without managing to finish a single song. I don't really have time for hobbies. I just practice coding all the time. 

I like sci-fi movies and tv shows, but usually the more cerebral stuff. The last thing the "SyFy" channel produced that I was interested in was Battlestar Galactica (spin-offs included). I was a really big fan of Star Trek: the Next Generation as a child, and remain a moderate trekie. 

My first bachelor's degree was in Political Science at Western Washington University. I graduated in 2009, which turned out to be a terrible year to look for an entry-level job. I got into software development because I thought I needed to learn a hard skill.

Programming Background

I have professional training in C, C++, Java and MASM, as well as autodidactic knowledge of Javascript and Php, including the AngularJS and JQuery libraries. 

This past summer, I was an intern at AT&T where, among other projects, I was lead developer on a project to build a small web application that is going to be used internally. It is a training course registration system. We used JQuery, Java Servlet, and MySql.

I am building a website for play-by-post role playing games. It uses AngularJS, Java Servlet, and MySql. At the moment, the only feature that is complete is use authentication. Passwords are stored as hashes on the server. After logging in, the user is given a session token which is stored as a cookie. The session token will need to be included in AJAX requests that require an authenticated user.
